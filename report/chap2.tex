Graphics are external visuals we present in our reports.\footnote{This is a loose definition. When we mention graphics, think of items you have generated outside of \LaTeX\ and are imported in.}

We usually `host' graphics in simple \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{figure\}} environments, like \Vref{fig:firsteg}, with a caption and footer. But sometimes we want to get a bit creative. 

This chapter demonstrates some non-standard graphics and non-standard placements.


    \begin{figure}
    \caption{International students have grown significantly}
    \units{International students by home country, thousands}
    \vspace{-7.5mm} %%This brings the figure up to overlap the label
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{atlas/mapping_recreation_15.png}
        \label{fig:firsteg} 
        \notewithsource{This is a short note.}{This is a standard source.}
    \end{figure}
    
    
    
    
    \begin{figure*}
    \caption{This is a huge figure}
    \units{Proportion of students applying to university in year 12}
        \includegraphics[page=2, width=2.15\columnwidth]{atlas/transition_fullpage.pdf}
        \label{fig:fullpage} 
        \notewithsource{This is a short note.}{This is a standard source.}
    \end{figure*}
